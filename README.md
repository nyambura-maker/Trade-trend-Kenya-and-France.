# Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Persistent Trade Deficit for Kenya
Kenya imports significantly more from France than it exports every year.
The average trade deficit is -15.59 billion KES, meaning Kenya buys more from France than it sells.
The deficit has widened over time, indicating increasing reliance on French imports.
2. Growth in Both Imports and Exports
Exports to France grew from 6.07B KES in 2015 to 15.55B KES in 2023.
However, imports from France grew even faster, from 21.07B KES in 2015 to 42.39B KES in 2023.
The fact that both are rising suggests growing trade relations, but Kenya is still a net importer.
3. Worsening Trade Deficit Over Time
In 2015, the deficit was -14.99B KES, but by 2023, it had widened to -26.84B KES.
This suggests that Kenya’s exports to France have not kept pace with its rising imports.
Possible Reasons for Kenya's Trade Deficit with France
Kenya’s Major Imports from France
include machinery, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, and processed goods, which Kenya does not produce in sufficient quantities.
Kenya’s Major Exports to France
Typically consist of tea, coffee, flowers, and raw materials, which have lower value than high-tech manufactured goods from France.
Limited Industrial Capacity
Kenya relies on imports for high-value manufactured goods while exporting mainly raw or semi-processed goods.

The percentage of imports that Frace gets from kenya is so minimal amounting into a 0.1% of all its imports while the percentage of imports that kenya gets from france is 1% of all its imports

# Implications & Recommendations
* Diversify and Add Value to Exports:
Kenya should invest in manufacturing and industrialization to increase high-value exports.

 *Promote Import Substitution:
Encourage local production of goods that are heavily imported from France.

*Enhance Trade Agreements with France:
Negotiate better trade terms to increase export opportunities and reduce dependence on imports.
